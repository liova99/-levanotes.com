# How To run Outlook rules once



I didn't found any "official" way. You could write you own macros, but this is not what someone want to do. 

I found a easy workaround which you may apply. 

So create you rule

![RulesWizard-Outlook](RulesWizard-Outlook.webp)

Click "Next" till the last page

Then!

Select "Run this rule now on messages already in Inbox"

**Deselect**  "Turn on this rule" 

Click Finish to run this rule once



![RulesWizard-Outlook2](RulesWizard-Outlook2.webp)



If you wan' t to run this rule again, got to  "Manage Rule & Alerts..."

![Manage-Rules-Outlook](Manage-Rules-Outlook.webp)

Double click your rule

![Rules-Alerts-Outlook](Rules-Alerts-Outlook.webp)



And repeat the steps above by clicking "Next" till the last page. 

Select like before  "Run this rule now on messages already in Inbox"

And click "Finish" to run this rule again
